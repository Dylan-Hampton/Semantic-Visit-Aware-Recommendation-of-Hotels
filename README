#Semantic Vist Aware Recommendation of Hotels

"http://sdmay23-34.sd.ece.iastate.edu/">

##Description
Our client has developed an algorithm to efficiently determine the optimal semantically diverse points of interest (PoI) as well as the optimal route between them given user constraints like maximum travel distance, preferred PoI categories, etc. Furthermore, our client has compiled a dataset of New York City that contains categorized PoIs and the road network that contains them.

The main objective of this project is to create a web application that creates a visualization for the algorithm mentioned above for travelers to display the optimal PoIs and the path between them as there are no current means to visualize the algorithms. Additionally, visualizations of other algorithms that determine paths between PoIs will be created to compare the PoI diversity along the routes to demonstrate the algorithm's effectiveness. Users will be able to input constraints from which the algorithm will compute the route to semantically diverse PoIs.
